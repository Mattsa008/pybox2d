==Help==

For now, the main documentation will be kept on the *Box2D [http://www.box2d.org/wiki/index.php?title=Box2D_with_Python wiki]*.

Please feel free to discuss your ideas and/or problems in the forums, also.

==Getting Started Manual==

I've started to convert the getting started with Box2D manual to Python. [http://www.box2d.org/wiki/index.php?title=Python_Manual Here] it is.

==Version Numbers==

The version numbers follow the main Box2D releases (currently 2.0.1) with a release number attached. For example, 2.0.1b3 is based on Box2D release 2.0.1 and is the third release of the bindings.

==Changes==

===2.0.2b0 (10/23/2008)===

First release that's not based on a major Box2D release. It combines Box2D SVN r177 and contributions from shaktool (thin line segment) and BorisTheBrave (controllers/buoyancy).

 * Thin line segment support (forum [http://www.box2d.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1577 post])
 * Buoyancy with generic controller support (forum [http://www.box2d.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=1664 post])
 * Pyglet 1.1 testbed (still has some issues. run convert-from-pygame.py to convert the tests from pygame)
 * OS X [Installer]
 * Python 2.6 support
 * Line joints (see test_LineJoint)
 * Raycasts (see test_RayCast or test_BoxCutter)
 * TestSegment
 * test_BreakableBody (forum [http://www.box2d.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=836 post])

===2.0.1b4 (6/1/2008)===

 * Supports comparing shapes, joints, bodies. Doesn't require using userData anymore.
 * Major clean ups with Box2D.i
 * Added some docstrings to Box2D.i functions
 * Added b2PolygonDef.checkValues(): checks the Polygon definition to see if upon creation it will cause an assertion to fail (raises ValueError)
 * Wrapped shape.GetCoreVertices() like GetVertices() (for test_TimeOfImpact)
 * test_Web fixed
 * All stuff prettily printed by a semi-automated process now
 * Updated test_Bridge.py to SVN rev 156
 * Added many comments to test_main

===2.0.1b3 (5/7/2008)===

 * Updated the interface to allow SetUserData() (absolutely necessary for setting the ground's userdata)
 * Fixed b2PolygonShape (.vertexCount is now private, so the accessor is used instead)
 * Release for Python 2.4
 * Linux (possibly OS X) support with setup.py
