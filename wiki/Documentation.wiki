==Help==

For now, the main documentation will be kept on the *Box2D [http://www.box2d.org/wiki/index.php?title=Box2D_with_Python wiki]*.

Please feel free to discuss your ideas and/or problems in the forums, also.

==Getting Started Manual==

I've started to convert the getting started with Box2D manual to Python. [http://www.box2d.org/wiki/index.php?title=Python_Manual Here] it is.

==Version Numbers==

The version numbers follow the main Box2D releases (currently 2.0.1) with a release number attached. For example, 2.0.1b3 is based on Box2D release 2.0.1 and is the third release of the bindings.

==Changes==

===2.0.1b3 (5/7/2008)===

 * Updated the interface to allow SetUserData() (absolutely necessary for setting the ground's userdata)
 * Fixed b2PolygonShape (.vertexCount is now private, so the accessor is used instead)
 * Release for Python 2.4
 * Linux (possibly OS X) support with setup.py
