== setuptools eggs ==

The [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools setuptools] eggs are available on this site and also on [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Box2D pypi]. 

To install these, first install [http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py setuptools] (by opening it with Python) and then run: easy_install box2d
This should find and download the appropriate eggs for your platform and install them in your site-lib directory. 

== OS X ==

== Dependencies ==

Requires the Python versions from the official [http://www.python.org/download/ site].  As with Pygame, this *does not* work with the Python that comes with OS X. Please use the official installer.

=== pygame ===

*pygame* is not included in the installer. If you want to try the testbed applications (and you should), you must install a few additional things. From the [http://www.pygame.org pygame] site:

[http://www.pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.8.1release-py2.5-macosx10.5.zip pygame-1.8.1release-py2.5-macosx10.5.zip] (for Python 2.5)

[http://www.pygame.org/ftp/pygame-1.8.1release-py2.4-macosx10.5.zip pygame-1.8.1release-py2.4-macosx10.5.zip] (for Python 2.4)

[http://www.pygame.org/ftp/pyobjc-1.4-py2.5-macosx10.4.mpkg.zip pyobjc-1.4-py2.5-macosx10.4.mpkg.zip] (required to use pygame)

The library itself is installed in Python's site-packages directory: */Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Box2D*

If, for some reason, you delete the site-packages and need to reinstall it (and the installer isn't putting the files there), you can try deleting */Library/Receipts/Box2D*
