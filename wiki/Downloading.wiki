==Download Notes==


===Windows Users===

Included in the installer is: The compiled library, the testbed, and the SWIG interface. They are installed to your Python\Box2D\ and Python\Lib\site-packages\Box2D2 directories.

After installing, see your Python/Box2D/testbed directory for the demos. They require [http://www.pygame.org pygame].


===Linux and OS X Users===

  #1 Download the Box2D source from [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/box2d/Box2D_v2.0.1.zip here] (the latest supported source). 
  #2 Install the latest version of [http://www.swig.org SWIG] with your package manager (hopefully it'll have 1.3.31+. OSX users might run into some problems with this).
  #3 Then download the SWIG interface file from the [http://pybox2d.googlecode.com/svn-history/r7/trunk/interface/Box2D.i SVN] and put it in Box2D/Source. Running 'python setup.py install' should then take care of the rest. Assuming you have pygame, you could then browse the ported testbed [http://pybox2d.googlecode.com/files/Box2D-testbed-2.0.1b3.zip demos].
