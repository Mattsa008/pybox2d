==Download Notes==

===Windows===

Simply download the latest release for your version of Python (2.4 or 2.5) [http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/downloads/list here].

Included in the installer is: 
 * Compiled library (installed in Python\Lib\site-packages\Box2D2\)
 * Testbed and demos. (installed in Python\Box2D\testbed)
 * SWIG interface. (installed in Python\Box2D\interface)

The testbed and demos require [http://www.pygame.org pygame].

If you want to build from source, the steps are essentially the same as for Linux, but slightly more messy.ã€€See the notes at the top of setup.py.

===Linux===

Starting with release 2.0.1b4, I will put a source release that includes the Box2D C++ source to make it easier to install on Linux. If you would like to do it manually from the latest SVN version, follow these steps:

  #1 Download and install the latest version of [http://www.swig.org SWIG] (preferably 1.3.31+) with your package manager.
   If you are using *Ubuntu*, you can install it via Synaptic Package Manager (package name 'swig'). You will also need to install the python-dev package, and build-essentials (and python-pygame if you want to run the testbed).
{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essentials python-dev swig python-pygame
}}}
  #2 Check out the SVN
{{{
svn checkout http://pybox2d.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pybox2d
}}}
  #3 Compile the Box2D static library
{{{
cd pybox2d/Box2D/
make
}}}
  #4 Build and install the pyBox2D library
{{{
python setup.py build
# Assuming everything goes well...
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

=== OS X ===
