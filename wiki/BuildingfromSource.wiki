===Building from Source===

===Linux===
Starting with release 2.0.1b4, I will put a source release that includes the Box2D C++ source to make it easier to install on Linux. If you would like to do it manually from the latest SVN version, follow these steps:

  #1 Download and install the latest version of [http://www.swig.org SWIG] (preferably 1.3.31+) with your package manager.
   If you are using *Ubuntu*, you can install it via Synaptic Package Manager (package name 'swig'). You will also need to install the python-dev package, and build-essentials (and python-pygame if you want to run the testbed).
{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essentials python-dev swig python-pygame
}}}
  #2 Check out the SVN
{{{
svn checkout http://pybox2d.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pybox2d
}}}
  #3 Compile the Box2D static library
{{{
cd pybox2d/Box2D/
make
}}}
  #4 Build and install the pyBox2D library
{{{
python setup.py build
# Assuming everything goes well...
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

===Windows===

  #1 Install [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MinGW-5.1.4.exe?modtime=1209244789&big_mirror=1 MinGW] and then [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe MSYS] so that you can compile Box2D and pyBox2D. 
  #2 Install [http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swigwin-1.3.36.zip SWIG] for making the Python wrapper. Install it in a location in your PATH, or add the SWIG directory to your PATH.
  #3 Create Python\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg, if it doesn't exist, and add:
{{{
[build]
compiler=mingw32
[build_ext]
compiler=mingw32
}}}
  #4 If you want to build from the SVN, install the [http://subversion.tigris.org/files/documents/15/43360/Setup-Subversion-1.5.1.en-us.msi Subversion client]. Check out the project by doing
{{{
svn checkout http://pybox2d.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ pybox2d
}}}
  #5 Run MSYS and locate your pybox2d directory
{{{
cd /c/path/to/pybox2d/Box2D
}}}
  #6 Build the Box2D static library
{{{
make
}}}
  #7 Build and install pyBox2D
{{{
setup.py build
setup.py install
}}}


=== OS X ===

==== OS X Installation Guide ====

As there is no installer for pyBox2D under OS X right now, you will have to build it from the source.

==== Dependencies ===

To build pyBox2D, you will need:
  * Apple Developer Tools (see below)
  * SWIG (see below)
  * Python (of course)

==== Install Apple Developer Tools ====

  # This step is only required if the Apple Developer tools have not already been installed. 
  # Download the Apple Developer Tools or install them from the System Installer CD provided with your Mac.
  # Download from: http://developer.apple.com/tools/
  # This will give your system all the tools it needs for software development.
  # These tools are required for you to proceed to the next step.

==== SWIG Installation ====

  # Download the latest source release of SWIG: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-1.3.36.tar.gz
  # Place the file onto your Desktop  
  # Open Terminal.app located in the Applications/Utilities folder
  # Then enter the following into the terminal window:
{{{
cd ~/Desktop
tar -zxf swig-*.tar.gz
cd swig-*
./configure
make
sudo make install
<ENTER THE ADMINISTRATOR/ROOT PASSWORD>
}}}
  # Hopefully all went well and no errors occurred.
  # Close the Terminal.app window
  # SWIG is now installed onto the system and we can now move to the next step.

==== pyBox2D Installation ====

  # Download the latest source distribution of pyBox2D: http://pybox2d.googlecode.com/files/pyBox2D-2.0.1b4-Source.zip
  # Place the file onto your Desktop  
  # Open Terminal.app located in the Applications/Utilities folder
  # Then enter the following into the terminal window:
{{{
cd ~/Desktop
unzip pyBox2D-*-Source.zip
cd pyBox2D-*-Source/Box2D/Source
make
python setup.py build
}}}
  # If you get this error: `ld: warning in Gen/float/libbox2d.a, file is not of required architecture`, run `python setup.py build` again.
{{{
sudo python setup.py install
<ENTER THE ADMINISTRATOR/ROOT PASSWORD>
}}}
  # Hopefully all went well and no errors occurred.
  # Close the Terminal.app window

==== Test pyBox2D Installation (optional) ====

  # NOTE: The pyBox2D testbed examples require pygame.
  # Download pygame from: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
  # For a simple gui installer download (as on pygame site): http://rene.f0o.com/~rene/stuff/macosx/pygame-1.8.0rc5-py2.5-macosx10.4.mpkg.zip
  # To test if the pyBox2D installation works we can see if the testbed examples included in the distribution run
{{{
cd ~/Desktop/pyBox2D-*-Source/Box2D/Python/testbed
python demos.py
}}}
  # At this stage take a look at the other examples provided. They are a good starting point to get an idea of how pyBox2D works.
  # For documentation / technical support to further your software development experience see the links on the project home page.

==== Building pyBox2D from the SVN ====

This is only necessary if you want the latest features that pyBox2D has to offer.
Follow the above headings *Install Apple Developer Tools* and *SWIG Installation*. Now follow the steps 2 and beyond for Linux.
